# dotOS - Kali 2 like a real boy
dotOS is a custom Kali 2 installation geared towards hackers who feel more comfortable with a keyboard and don't appreciate the delays introduced by using a mouse all the time.   
Build with Kali 2, i3wm, fish shell, ptf, vimperator (firefox), conky and a few extra things here and there that make [my](https://twitter.com/kussic) hacking more streamlined.

>Step by step instructions below. Your milleage may vary since things do change every now and again. If some instruction doesn't work fix it and then let me know. _I'm not your customer support  desk!_

0. Skip step (2) below and download the iso   
    Go to the [i3wm-kali-rolling release] (https://github.com/kussic/dotOS/releases/tag/i3wm-kali-rolling) and download the iso.

1. OR Build your custom Kali 2 i3wm iso   
    From an existing Kali installation run the following commands:
	```
	apt-get update
	apt-get install curl git live-build cdebootstrap
	git clone git://git.kali.org/live-build-config.git
	cd live-build-config
	```
	At this point you can customise the contents of the distribution, by default it's the full Kali install with everything included.
	If you're okay with this skip the next step and go straight to the __"./build.sh [...]"__ command below.
	I personally hate bloat so I tweak __"kali-config/variant-i3wm/package-lists/kali.list.chroot"__ to only install the Top 10 by default:
	```
	# You always want those
	kali-linux
	kali-desktop-live

	# Kali applications

	# You can customize the set of Kali applications to install
	# (-full is the default, -all is absolutely everything, the rest
	# corresponds to various subsets)
	# kali-linux-full
	# kali-linux-all
	# kali-linux-sdr
	# kali-linux-gpu
	# kali-linux-wireless
	# kali-linux-web
	# kali-linux-forensic
	# kali-linux-voip
	# kali-linux-pwtools
	kali-linux-top10
	# kali-linux-rfid

	# Graphical desktop
	kali-desktop-common
	xorg
	dmenu
	conky
	i3
	```
	I deal with everything else during post installation. This makes a leaner disk and a smaller install size and time.

			
	Run the build script:
	`./build.sh --distribution kali-rolling --variant i3wm --verbose`

	>NOTE: this will take its sweet time, at the end you will have an .iso file if everything went right!

2. Install Kali 2
